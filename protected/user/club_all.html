                        Sleep plays an important role in human life, not only as a necessary process for physical rest and recovery, but also
                        has a profound impact on brain function, emotional regulation and health conditions. Sleep culture reflects a society's
                        attention to sleep and the way to deal with sleep. Whether it's a traditional culture that emphasizes regular schedules,
                        or a modern fast-paced culture, maintaining good sleep habits and valuing adequate sleep are essential for health and
                        well-being. On a global scale, sleep culture is also influenced by the communication between different cultures. The
                        diversity of sleep habits and ideas allows people to learn from different cultures to improve their sleep quality and
                        quality of life.
